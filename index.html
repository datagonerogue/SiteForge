        Hello! I'm Smarth Arora, a passionate and motivated computer science
        student with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.
        Currently pursuing my Master of Integrated Technology in Computer
        Science at Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, I am eager to

        <h3>2010-2020.</h3>

        <p>
          From my teenage years, I've been captivated by the world of computers.
          I still remember configuring the control panel of Windows 7 on my old
          PC. The thrill of tweaking settings and understanding how the system
          worked fueled my curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, as I got a low end laptop from my family, a friend introduced
          me to the intriguing realm of Linux, starting with the powerful Kali
          Linux for delving into ethical hacking. I began experimenting with
          various Linux distributions, each offering a unique perspective on the
          power and flexibility of this operating system. The freedom to
          customize, tinker, and learn became the driving force behind my
          <span title="Changing Linux distributions continuously"
            >"<i>distrohopping</i>"</span
          >. From Ubuntu to Fedora, I expanded my knowledge with each
          installation.
        </p>

        <h3>2020-2022.</h3>

        <p>
          In the Pandemic Lockdown, I discovered the extent of control that big
          tech companies wield over the internet today. I made a conscious
          decision to prioritize my digital well-being. This led me to the world
          of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I believe in the power of
          technology that respects user freedom, privacy, and transparency.
          Consequently, I've transitioned to using predominantly FOSS, finding
          it not only beneficial for my privacy but also more efficient in the
          day-to-day life.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I deepened my understanding of the digital landscape, I naturally
          evolved into a digital rights advocate. I strongly believe in the
          right to privacy, digital freedom, and the importance of informed
          choices in the digital realm. Advocating for policies that protect
          these rights has become a cause close to my heart.
        </p>

        <h3>2022-Present.</h3>

        <p>
          Since joining my college, my exploration of the digital realm has
          taken a fascinating turn. After getting a powerful laptop, I ventured
          into the world of self-hosting and embraced the philosophy of Free and
          Open Source Software (FOSS). On my older laptop, I've been running an
          ecosystem of FOSS projects, including Nextcloud for personal cloud
          services, Adguard Home for enhanced online security, and FreshRSS for
          a clutter-free news experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My deep dive into the world of FOSS led me to appreciate the
          philosophy of minimalism. I firmly believe in the power of simplicity,
          and it reflects not only in the software I choose, but also in the
          design of this website. Majorly crafted with basic HTML and CSS, this
          site mirrors my commitment to a streamlined and clutter-free digital
          experience. As I believe in delivering a clean and lightweight digital
          experience, by adhering to this minimalistic approach.
